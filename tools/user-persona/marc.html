		<p class="question">A quick overview of who you are ?</p>
		<p>I'm Marc, 34 years old. I live in Bordeaux, and I am one of the 2 cofounders of a small web agency.</p>
		<p class="question">What is your role in this company ?</p>
		<p>I handle all the commercial tasks. The other cofounder is more a tech guy, so he's in charge of all our dev work. I can understand few tech things but my job is mostly to look for clients, arrange contracts, and support. <strong>I'm anyway the one and only point of contact for my clients when they need anything related to their website.</strong> They always know how to find me.</p>

		<p class="question">What kind of clients do you mostly work with ?</p>
		<p>We now have about 12 regular clients. We handle almost always all their "Internet strategy" : website development, hosting, SEO, analytics, emailing,... They are mostly corporate websites (lawyers, restaurants, local industrial companies,...). We just signed our first e-commerce client so we have to find new solutions and new tools (we used to create most of our websites by using Wordpress or Drupal). In any case, we are selling a turnkey solution with a full access to the CMS backoffice or to related services like Google Analytics. We even offer trainings on these backoffices but we know very well that <strong>all our clients always end up by coming back to us for any need related to their website</strong> : create a new page, change a title, or know the traffic of their website for the last month.</p>
		<p class="question">What is your usage of Google Analytics ?</p>
		<p>I'm quite comfortable with Google Analytics. I'm the one who has to get the job done when a client requires some information so I know very well how to grab specific numbers. But I'm not an analytics guy, so I'm not able to give them specific analysis or interesting insights. <strong>When they need a number I can almost always give it to them, but that's it. And it takes a lot of time so I try to avoid it unless they ask me.</strong></p>

		<p class="question">How often do they ask you analytics information ?</p>
		<p>It really depends on the client : every week, every month, sometimes they even never ask. <strong>I think that they are all interested in their analytics, but they just don't ask with the same strength !</strong> All of them would probably like to have more information about their analytics. Of course, they have full access to Google Analytics, but they don't have the time to really dive into it to be independant. I try to give them an answer quickly, but I also have a lot of things to do, and sometimes it takes several days. I wish I could send them periodical reports on their analytics, but I know that won't be enough, they also need a translation to understand the meaning of these numbers.</p>
		<p class="question">Can you describe a real use case ?</p>
		<p>Last month, one of our clients made a showcase of its product on a famous professional event. The next week, he asked me to know the conversion of the dedicated landing page that we created for this event. I received the email on Monday, but I knew I will need some time to find the conversion rate and I had a lot of other things to do, so I waited until Tuesday before starting to work on it.<br/>It's easy for me to access any of my clients analytics because I always add my google account to the analytics users of any website that we create (on top of our clients account). But it's a real pain for me to find the proper numbers. <strong>I'm really affraid to do a mistake and I don't like to have this responsability on something that I don't really understand.</strong> So basically I tried to find the traffic on this landing page, and the traffic on the confirmation page (the one that comes right after the subscription on the landing page), and I calculated the conversion rate. I spent about 30 minutes on this process. That seems to be quick but <strong>I can't spend so much time on small request of all my clients.</strong></p>

		<p class="question">What do you know about qunb ?</p>
		<p>I discovered qunb on Twitter, but I have to say that I did not really used it yet (I just tried to create a story with the website of my agency). From what I understood, it's a webservice that allows people to create slideshows from their analytics. I noticed that you can receive periodical updates, so I don't know if I could send these updates to my clients, but I'm interested.</p>
		<p class="question">What benefits would have to put qunb in this model ?</p>
		<p>I think I could be interested in two things. Firstly, being able to send a periodical update to my clients. Not only raw numbers, but <strong>something that they could understand without any help.</strong> Something that they could share with their colleagues, something cool that they would like to receive every week or every month. I would like to let them know that I take care of their analytics, and that <strong>I provide them the best tools.</strong><br/>Secondly, I would like being able to gather some material before meetings with clients. <strong>I would really love being able to trigger a new intervention with one of my clients based on analytics insights.</strong> Being data driven would really help me to justify new services, and offering autonomy on their analytics to my clients could make the difference with my competitors.</p>
