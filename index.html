				<h2>Design practice</h2>
				<p class="quote">"Without a practice, you’re just doing design — a short-term activity. But when you practice design, you’re focusing on long-term sustainable success."<br/><span>Verne Ho</span></p>

			<p>Whether you realize it or not, you are constantly designing. Making a decision is designing.<br/>
			Here, we'll "only" talk about product design, the process of making decisions about how a product will behave, as a bridge between people and their goals on the user's side, and between a business and its revenue on the company's side.</p>
			<p>This design practice aims to enable these design decisions to be :
				<ul>

					<li><strong>Intentional</strong> : Decisions are made on purpose</li>
					<li><strong>Conscious</strong> : Decisions are made with "the whole" and "the next" in mind</li>
					<li><strong>Autonomous</strong> : Decisions do not depend too much on people making them</li>
					<!-- <li><strong>Repeatable</strong> : Decisions are not the result of a lottery</li> -->

					<!-- <li><strong>Scalable</strong> : It enables to easily integrate new members</li> -->
					<!-- <li><strong>Repeatable</strong> : It ensures outcome isn’t a lottery</li>
					<li><strong>Autonomous</strong> : It doesn't depends too much on people using it</li>
					<li><strong>Intentional</strong> : It ensures decisions are made on purpose</li> -->
					<!-- <li><strong>Transparent</strong> : It is clear and accessible to anyone</li> -->
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The practice is meant to guide design decision, not to constraint it.<br/>
			It helps to start in the good direction, and to keep in mind important parts of the design journey.</p>
			<p>We defined 4 steps driven by their main purposes :
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Understand</strong> : Know the users, the product, the problem and the context.</li>
					<li><strong>Diverge</strong> : Explore a broad range of solutions.</li>
					<li><strong>Converge</strong> : Select a proposal and focus the work on it.</li>
					<li><strong>Learn</strong> : Review, and document the work.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>For each step, we'll state clear goals, and provide some heuristics to help you to assess your success. We'll also list some useful tools to reach these goals.</p>
			<p>This is <strong>an iterative process</strong>. Once you learned from your previous attempts, you can try to understand, diverge, converge and learn again.<br>
			This is also <strong>a recursive process</strong>. You can apply the whole process to smaller parts of your current cycle (for instance, design decisions about error handling inside a bigger process of designing an onboarding).</p>
			<p>As in many activities (painting, music,...), it's indeed easier to start with the big picture before diving into details. Start by using this framework to define the main direction of your design, and then stick with it when you'll have to work on smaller parts.<br>
			Benefits of following a clear vision are often higher in the long term than diverging for micro-decisions, even when they seem better when isolated.</p>
			<!-- <p>Keep in mind that the goal of your design is not to find the perfect solution, because there is no such solution, the goal is to find the best compromise.</p> -->
