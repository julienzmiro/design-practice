				<h2>Design practice</h2>
				<p class="quote">"Without a practice, you’re just doing design — a short-term activity. But when you practice design, you’re focusing on long-term sustainable success."<br/><span>Verne Ho</span></p>

		<div class="row">
			<p>Whether you realize it or not, you are constantly designing. Making a decision is designing.<br/>
				Here, we'll "only" talk about product design, the process of making decisions about how a product will behave, as a bridge between people and their goals on the user's side, and between a business and its revenue on the company's side.</p>
			<p>This design practice aims to enable these design decisions to be :
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Relevant</strong> : Decisions are focused on the first use case</li>
					<li><strong>Intentional</strong> : Decisions are made on purpose</li>
					<li><strong>Conscious</strong> : Decisions are made with "the whole" and "the next" in mind</li>
					<li><strong>Opportunistic</strong> : Decisions leverage all the opportunities to convey meaning (animations, urls, tab title,...)</li>
					<li><strong>Autonomous</strong> : Decisions do not depend too much on people making them</li>
					<li><strong>Audacious</strong> : Decisions diverge from existing patterns when it makes sense</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The practice is meant to guide design decision, not to constraint it.<br/>
				It helps to start in the good direction, and to keep in mind important parts of the design journey.</p>
			<p>We defined 4 steps driven by their main purposes :
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Understand</strong> : Know the users, the product, the problem and the context.</li>
					<li><strong>Diverge</strong> : Explore a broad range of solutions.</li>
					<li><strong>Converge</strong> : Select a proposal and focus the work on it.</li>
					<li><strong>Learn</strong> : Review, and document the work.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>For each step, we'll state clear goals, and provide some heuristics to help you to assess your success. We'll also list some useful tools to reach these goals.</p>
			<p>This is <strong>an iterative process</strong>. Once you learned from your previous attempts, you can try to understand, diverge, converge and learn again.<br>
				This is also <strong>a recursive process</strong>. You can apply the whole process to smaller parts of your current cycle (for instance, design decisions about error handling inside a bigger process of designing an onboarding).</p>
			<p>As in many activities (painting, music,...), it's indeed easier to start with the big picture before diving into details. Start by using this framework to define the main direction of your design, and then stick with it when you'll have to work on smaller parts.<br>
				Benefits of following a clear vision are often higher in the long term than diverging for micro-decisions, even when they seem better when isolated.</p>

			<p>It's a common mistake to try to solve a problem that has not been defined yet.<br/>Understanding should always be your first concern. By building a solid knowledge of the problem, you create the best context to find a solution more efficiently.</p>
			<p>There's a lot of things that need to be defined :
				<ul>
					<li><strong>The users</strong> : Their needs, their goals, their frustations, their behaviours,...</li>
					<li><strong>The product</strong> : Its scope (what parts of the product are concerned ?), its direction, existing design decisions,...</li>
					<li><strong>The context</strong> : Deadline, stakeholders, priority,...</li>
					<li><strong>The problem</strong> : What will you try to solve, what is the intended outcome, how will you measure the success,...</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Users interviews</strong> : Get "raw materials" about existing usages.</li>
				<li><strong>Brief</strong> : Get key informations about a project.</li>
				<li><strong>Existing design documents</strong> : Look for things to learn from existing decisions.</li>
				<li><strong>User's personas</strong> : Define your users by starting from tangible use cases and users' goals.</li>
				<li><strong>Brand persona</strong> : Picture your brand as a person.</li>
				<li><strong>Benchmark</strong> : Get insights from existing solutions.</li>
				<li><strong>Jobs to be done framework</strong> :  Frame a complicated problem in a simple statement.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Heuristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you know what you are trying to solve, or to achieve ?</li>
				<li>Do you know how you will measure success ?</li>
				<li>Do you have users' personas for this product ? If no, have you at least identified users' goals ?</li>
				<li>At the end of this process, will you be able to know if a user had achieved these users' goals ?</li>
				<li>Do you know the constraints (scope, time, technical, strategy,...) ?</li>
				<li>Do you think that what you'll try to achieve is realistic given these constraints ? If no, should you break this design process into smaller ones ?</li>
				<li>Is there any part of this design that seems really important, or particularly risky ? If so, do you think that it deserves a dedicated process ?</li>
				<li>Do you have all the informations that you need to work ? If no, do you know where to find them ?</li>
				<li>Is there any document about existing design decisions related to this ?</li>

		<div class="row">
			<p>By building a better knowledge, you probably already have a first idea of how you'll achieve your design.<br/>
				It's fine, but before diving more deeply into this idea, you should now take some time to consider other trails to follow. Solutions are many, and what is now obvious is not enough at this step.</p>
			<p>It's important to go beyond all the common boundaries : go beyond your first idea, go beyond "the usual canvas" (do not design screens, design systems), go beyond standards and conventions, go beyond the initial brief, go beyond technical constraints (pretend it's magic).<br/><strong>Everything should be questionable at this step.</strong></p>
			<p>Explore, try, test, change, twist, skew... <strong>your goal is to find many approaches to your problem, to reveal opportunities that we'll leverage later on the process.</strong></p>
			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Behavioral triggers</strong> : Explore solutions by starting from users' motivations and behaviors.</li>
				<li><strong>Storytelling of use cases</strong> : Draw the big picture of what your trying to solve before starting to dive into details.</li>
				<li><strong>Ideas tree</strong> : Browse ideas through 3 simple questions : "how", "why", and "what else".</li>
				<li><strong>Make them talk</strong> : Create a natural flow by performing a conversation between your user's persona and your brand's persona.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Heuristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Have you been able to go beyond your first idea ?</li>
				<li>Did you try to challenge existing patterns, standards and conventions ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to think without constraints in mind ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to explore all your ideas as much as you want ?</li>

			<p>It's time to decide !<br/>
				You'll now leverage all the material produced to focus your work on one proposal.
				Of course, that doesn't mean that this will be the best nor the final solution. Nothing is set in the stone and the last step of the process could help you to identify the next improvements. But for now, let's see how to come to a proper solution.</p>
			<p>This step of the process is about two things : picking the right idea, and fine-tuning it.<br/>
				<strong>At the end, you should be able to deliver "something" that will clearly communicate your design decision.</strong></p>
			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>How does this help</strong> : Pick the good idea by asking a simple question in front of your personas' goals and frustations.</li>
				<li><strong>Design review</strong> : Get feedback and introduce constraints in the process.</li>
				<li><strong>Design principles</strong> : Ensure that a decision is following the good direction in terms of product vision.</li>
				<li><strong>Design guidelines</strong> : Ensure that a decision is following domain specific rules and standards (visual, interaction, copy).</li>
				<li><strong>Space-time design method</strong> : Spread a task in the flow and frame it in the layout.</li>
				<li><strong>What's the FUC ?*</strong> : Remove everything that is not required to achieve the first use case of your design.<br/><small>* First Use Case</small></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Heuristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you have one chosen solution ?</li>
				<li>Do you think this solution helps the user to reach its goals ? Have you tested it in front of users ?</li>
				<li>And what about business goals ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to share this solution with other people ?</li>
				<li>Is it realistic ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to deliver something that communicate efficiently this decision ?</li>
				<li>Are you sure you can't remove anything from your proposal ?</li>
				<li>Are you sure that this solution is in line with the existing product guidelines ? If no, do you have a good reason to diverge, and are you able to explain it ?</li>

			<p>Now you should have something clear and exhaustive to communicate. But that's probably a very short term communication : "what should we do to fit this user's need ?"... what about the valuable journey that allowed you to reach this solution ?</p>
			<p>At this step of the cycle, your goal is mostly to communicate for a long term benefit: beyond your design decision, you now need to talk about <strong>how you ended up to this result</strong>.<br/>
				You also want to open new opportunities. After all this work, you probably have new ideas, or even new doubts about this project. <strong>So don't hesitate to sow the seeds of future design decisions to be made.</strong>

			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Design rationale</strong> : Explain the most important or the most interesting design decisions and talk about next things to do.</li>
				<li><strong>Guidelines</strong> : Enhance existing guidelines with new components or patterns.</li>
				<li><strong>Team review</strong> : Allow anyone to give feedback on how this project has been handled.</li>

			<h3>Heuristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Have you been able to save your doubts or your perspectives of improvements for this project ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to save all the important insights gathered during this cycle ?</li>
				<li>Do you think that someone totally new to this project would be able to find all the important information required to understand your work ?</li>
