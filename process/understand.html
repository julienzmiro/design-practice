			<p>It's a common mistake to try to solve a problem that has not been defined yet.<br/>Understanding should always be your first concern. By building a solid knowledge of the problem, you create the best context to find a solution more efficiently.</p>
			<!-- <h3>Goals</h3> -->
			<p>There's a lot of things that need to be defined :
				<ul>
					<li><strong>The users</strong> : Their needs, their goals, their frustations, their behaviours,...</li>
					<li><strong>The product</strong> : Its scope (what parts of the product are concerned ?), its direction, existing design decisions,...</li>
					<li><strong>The context</strong> : Deadline, stakeholders, priority,...</li>
					<li><strong>The problem</strong> : What will you try to solve, what is the intended outcome, how will you measure the success,...</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Users interviews</strong> : Get "raw materials" about existing usages.</li>
				<li><strong>Brief</strong> : Get key informations about a project.</li>
				<li><strong>Existing design documents</strong> : Look for things to learn from existing decisions.</li>
				<!-- <li><strong><a href="../tools/user-persona/index.html" title="User's personas">User's personas</a></strong> : Define your users by starting from tangible use cases and users' goals.</li> -->
				<li><strong>User's personas</strong> : Define your users by starting from tangible use cases and users' goals.</li>
				<li><strong>Brand persona</strong> : Picture your brand as a person.</li>
				<li><strong>Benchmark</strong> : Get insights from existing solutions.</li>
				<li><strong>Jobs to be done framework</strong> :  Frame a complicated problem in a simple statement.</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- <h3>Deliveries</h3>
			<p>You don't really need to deliver anything at this step. The most important being the knowledge that you will acquire. Still, some documents can help you to keep track of important information, and can help you to communicate them to others : Users interviews reports, personas, benchmark documentation,...</p>
			<h3>Tests</h3>
			<p>At this early stage of the design process, you can only test assumptions on your understanding (of your users, of the problem,...). The best way to do this is probably through your users' interviews or user's tests on existing solutions.</p> -->
			<h3>Heuristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you know what you are trying to solve, or to achieve ?</li>
				<li>Do you know how you will measure success ?</li>
				<li>Do you have users' personas for this product ? If no, have you at least identified users' goals ?</li>
				<li>At the end of this process, will you be able to know if a user had achieved these users' goals ?</li>
				<!-- <li>Do you know which parts of the product are concerned ?</li> -->
				<li>Do you know the constraints (scope, time, technical, strategy,...) ?</li>
				<li>Do you think that what you'll try to achieve is realistic given these constraints ? If no, should you break this design process into smaller ones ?</li>
				<li>Is there any part of this design that seems really important, or particularly risky ? If so, do you think that it deserves a dedicated process ?</li>
				<li>Do you have all the informations that you need to work ? If no, do you know where to find them ?</li>
				<li>Is there any document about existing design decisions related to this ?</li>
				<!-- <li>Are you comfortable with the vision behind this product ? (the goal beyond making money)</li> -->
