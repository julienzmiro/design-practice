			<p>It's time to decide !<br/>
				You'll now leverage all the material produced to focus your work on one proposal.
				Of course, that doesn't mean that this will be the best nor the final solution. Nothing is set in the stone and the last step of the process could help you to identify the next improvements. But for now, let's see how to come to a proper solution.</p>
			<!-- <h3>Goals</h3> -->
			<p>This step of the process is about two things : picking the right idea, and fine-tuning it.<br/>
				<strong>At the end, you should be able to deliver "something" that will clearly communicate your design decision.</strong></p>
			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>How does this help</strong> : Pick the good idea by asking a simple question in front of your personas' goals and frustations.</li>
				<li><strong>Design review</strong> : Get feedback and introduce constraints in the process.</li>
				<li><strong>Design principles</strong> : Ensure that a decision is following the good direction in terms of product vision.</li>
				<li><strong>Design guidelines</strong> : Ensure that a decision is following domain specific rules and standards (visual, interaction, copy).</li>
				<li><strong>Space-time design method</strong> : Spread a task in the flow and frame it in the layout.</li>
				<li><strong>What's the FUC ?*</strong> : Remove everything that is not required to achieve the first use case of your design.<br/><small>* First Use Case</small></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Heuristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you have one chosen solution ?</li>
				<li>Do you think this solution helps the user to reach its goals ? Have you tested it in front of users ?</li>
				<li>And what about business goals ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to share this solution with other people ?</li>
				<li>Is it realistic ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to deliver something that communicate efficiently this decision ?</li>
				<li>Are you sure you can't remove anything from your proposal ?</li>
				<li>Are you sure that this solution is in line with the existing product guidelines ? If no, do you have a good reason to diverge, and are you able to explain it ?</li>
			</ul> 
			<!-- <h3>Deliveries</h3>
			<p>Depending on how much confident you are on your solution, you can deliver low or high fidelity documents. The only thing important is that these documents should clearly describe all your design decisions. Then you will have to test your deliveries to minimize risks. When you are really confident on your design, you can publish a final delivery.</p>
			<h3>Tests</h3>
			<p>Don't hesitate to test the same idea at different level of fidelity. Test your scenarios or your wireframes on paper; test your visual design on high fidelity prototypes. You can use very different kind of tests depending on the context, and on what you are trying to check : usability testing, heuristic review, subjective survey, A/B testing,...</p> -->
