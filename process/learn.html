			<!-- <p>It might be tempting to think that your work is now done. <strong>But keep in mind that some of the tools that you used in this process have been produced during this step of a previous design cycle.</strong> So don't overlook this part of your work !</p> -->
			<p>Now you should have something clear and exhaustive to communicate. But that's probably a very short term communication : "what should we do to fit this user's need ?"... what about the valuable journey that allowed you to reach this solution ?</p>
			<!-- <p><strong>You also need to communicate for a long term viewpoint.</strong><br>You need to communicate about this design decision, but also about how you ended up to this decision, about potential improvements, about impacts of this decision, about what you learned from this project. Because you learned a lot of things by doing, trying, testing, and it's now time to gather all these insights.<br>
			At the end of this step, you will probably even have new ideas or new doubts for this project. That means that you might have to work again on some parts of this project, and apply again this process. It's ok! It's an iterative process. Maybe you'll only work on a different scope, probably a smaller one to fine-tune touchy parts of the design (micro interactions, content, visuals design of components,...).</p> -->
			<!-- <h3>Goals</h3> -->
			<!-- <p>Here, you'll basically need to achieve 2 things : review your work and create a documentation that you will be able to leverage in the future.</p> -->
			<p>At this step of the cycle, your goal is mostly to communicate for a long term benefit: beyond your design decision, you now need to talk about <strong>how you ended up to this result</strong>.<br/>
			You also want to open new opportunities. After all this work, you probably have new ideas, or even new doubts about this project. <strong>So don't hesitate to sow the seeds of future design decisions to be made.</strong>
			</p>

			<!-- <p>At this step of the cycle, your goal is mostly to communicate your design decision for a long term benefit. To do so, think about the future "you" and try to think about what this "you" would need in the next design project : more than knowing about your design decision, "you" will need to know about <strong>how you ended up to this decision</strong>.<br/>
			You also want to open new opportunities. After all this work, you probably have new ideas, or even new doubts about this project. <strong>So don't hesitate to sow the seeds of future design decisions to be made.</strong>
			</p> -->
			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<ul>
				<!-- <li><strong>Tests</strong> : A way to .</li> -->
				<li><strong>Design rationale</strong> : Explain the most important or the most interesting design decisions and talk about next things to do.</li>
				<li><strong>Guidelines</strong> : Enhance existing guidelines with new components or patterns.</li>
				<li><strong>Team review</strong> : Allow anyone to give feedback on how this project has been handled.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Heuristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Have you been able to save your doubts or your perspectives of improvements for this project ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to save all the important insights gathered during this cycle ?</li>
				<li>Do you think that someone totally new to this project would be able to find all the important information required to understand your work ?</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- <h3>Deliveries</h3>
			<p>Your delievries are mostly a gathering of all your previous deliveries : personas, user flows, design rationales, testing reports,... try to create the best format to be able to leverage these documents on next projects.</p> -->
