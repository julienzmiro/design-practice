			<p>By building a better knowledge, you probably already have a first idea of how you'll achieve your design.<br/>
				It's fine, but before diving more deeply into this idea, you should now take some time to consider other trails to follow. Solutions are many, and what is now obvious is not enough at this step.</p>
			<!-- <p>Solutions are many. The obvious is not enough at this step.<br/>Explore, try, test, change, twist, skew... <strong>your goal is to find many approaches to your problem, to reveal opportunities that we'll leverage later on the process.</strong></p> -->
			<p>It's important to go beyond all the common boundaries : go beyond your first idea, go beyond "the usual canvas" (do not design screens, design systems), go beyond standards and conventions, go beyond the initial brief, go beyond technical constraints (pretend it's magic).<br/><strong>Everything should be questionable at this step.</strong></p>
			<!-- <h3>Goals</h3> -->
			<p>Explore, try, test, change, twist, skew... <strong>your goal is to find many approaches to your problem, to reveal opportunities that we'll leverage later on the process.</strong></p>
			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Behavioral triggers</strong> : Explore solutions by starting from users' motivations and behaviors.</li>
				<li><strong>Storytelling of use cases</strong> : Draw the big picture of what your trying to solve before starting to dive into details.</li>
				<li><strong>Ideas tree</strong> : Browse ideas through 3 simple questions : "how", "why", and "what else".</li>
				<li><strong>Make them talk</strong> : Create a natural flow by performing a conversation between your user's persona and your brand's persona.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Heuristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Have you been able to go beyond your first idea ?</li>
				<li>Did you try to challenge existing patterns, standards and conventions ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to think without constraints in mind ?</li>
				<li>Have you been able to explore all your ideas as much as you want ?</li>
			</ul>
