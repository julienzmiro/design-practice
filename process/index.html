			<p>The practice is meant to guide design decision, not to constraint it.<br/>
				It helps to start in the good direction, and to keep in mind important parts of the design journey.</p>
			<p>We defined 4 steps driven by their main purposes :
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Understand</strong> : Know the users, the product, the problem and the context.</li>
					<li><strong>Diverge</strong> : Explore a broad range of solutions.</li>
					<li><strong>Converge</strong> : Select a proposal and focus the work on it.</li>
					<li><strong>Learn</strong> : Review, and document the work.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>For each step, we'll try to define clear goals. We'll also list some useful tools to reach these goals. Finally, we'll provide some heuristics to help you to assess your success.</p>
			<p>This is <strong>an iterative process</strong>. Once you learned from your previous attempts, you can try to understand, diverge, converge and learn again.<br>
				This is also <strong>a recursive process</strong>. You can apply the whole process to smaller parts of your current process (for instance, design decisions about error handling inside a bigger process of designing an onboarding).</p>
